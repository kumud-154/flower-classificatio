# Objective
- The goal is to pick an image of flowers then classify it.

- The data files contain 4323 RGB image.

- The data contain 5 types (daisy, Rose, dandelion, sunflower, tulip).

- Each type has its folder contain its images. 

# Steps
- Loading libraries will be used like (keras, seaborn,
pandas, numpy, â€¦ ).

- Loading data and discover how it was stored.

- Detecting shape of images to get a shape which the images will be converted to then resize images.

- Normalize all data.

- Splitting data to training part and test part by ratio 9:1.

- Creating model and train it 70 epochs.

- Evaluating mode and read a final value for accuracy.

- Test model in some samples.

# Evaluation
-  plot graph for train accuracy evaluation with each epoch.
